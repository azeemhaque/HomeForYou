HomeForYou - Pune House Price Prediction
Welcome to the HomeForYou Pune House Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive model and accompanying website that forecasts house prices in Pune, India. This project includes various phases such as data analysis, feature engineering, outlier detection and removal, model creation, setting up a Flask server, and creating a user-friendly UI website.


-> Overview
The HomeForYou project aims to provide accurate house price predictions for Pune, a bustling city in India with a dynamic real estate market. Whether you are a homebuyer looking for the perfect property or a real estate investor seeking insights into the market trends, this project has you covered.


-> Key Features
Data Exploration: We've performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, understand its features, and identify patterns and trends in the Pune real estate market.

Feature Engineering: We've engineered relevant features to improve the model's predictive accuracy. This includes transforming and scaling data, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.

Outlier Detection and Removal: We've implemented techniques to identify and remove outliers from the dataset, ensuring that the model is robust to extreme data points.

Model Creation: We've developed a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices in Pune with high accuracy. The model is trained on a clean and preprocessed dataset.

Flask Server: We've set up a Flask server to serve the predictive model. This server handles incoming requests and responds with house price predictions.

User-Friendly UI Website: We've created a user-friendly website that allows users to input property details and get instant house price predictions. The website is designed for ease of use and provides a seamless user experience.

In conclusion, HomeForYou is not just a predictive model; it's a comprehensive system that encompasses data analysis, feature engineering, outlier handling, model creation, server establishment, and a user-friendly website. This project has been a fulfilling experience, and I'm proud to offer a valuable tool that can assist individuals and businesses in making informed decisions about Pune's housing market.
